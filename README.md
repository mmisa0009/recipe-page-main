## My process

- 1 design with figma to get to know basic deisign elements (looking back, I did not have to do this.)
- 2 build basic html structure
- 3 build css stylesheet
- 4 modify the small parts and check on live

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (stylesheet: styles.css)
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Used rem and em to make a responsive website (able to extend the screen). Learned basics of the css styling and html. 


### Continued development

More smooth usage of css styling sheet. Would like to learn animation or more responsive website building. 

### Useful resources

- Kevin Powell (https://www.youtube.com/kevinpowell) - This helped learn why certain css coding does not work, and how to fix it. Highly recommend for practical advice.
